## What does EarTrainer do?

EarMeOut is an Amazon Alexa Skill we developed at McHacks V 2018. Our team decided to develop EarTrainer to help beginner or even aspiring musicians to develop their ear training with intervals.

### Identifying The Problem
Growing up, playing an instrument was required in most cases whether it was in band class, or learning to play on your own.  Part of these lessons were practical test where one would have to identify the musical interval solely through hearing.  But how would one practice for these listening tests?  The obvious answer would be to practice with the teacher but unfortunately that's not possible sometimes.  Another solution would be to practice on your own but how?

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/liujennifer/EarTrainer/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
