## What does EarTrainer do?
EarMeOut is an Amazon Alexa Skill we developed at McHacks V 2018. Our team decided to develop EarTrainer to help beginner or even aspiring musicians to develop their ear training with intervals.

### Identifying The Problem
Growing up, playing an instrument was required in most cases whether it was in band class, or learning to play on your own.  Part of these lessons were practical test where one would have to identify the musical interval solely through hearing.  But how would one practice for these listening tests?  The obvious answer would be to practice with the teacher but unfortunately that's not possible sometimes.  Another solution would be to practice on your own but how?

### The Solution
Amazon's Alexa is new great tool that can recreate a practice environment much like the ones someone would experience while practicing for listening test.  Alexa is ideal for creating such environments because it doesn't require sight.  Our Alexa skill will play a random interval and ask the user to identify it(e.g. 'unison', 'perfect fourth', etc.) then telling them if they're right or wrong, allowing the user to practice simple intervals without the need of another person.
